🌱 I’m currently learning how to prepare, design, and optimize Machine Learning Models.<br>
👯 I’m looking to collaborate on new and ongoing AI trends.<br>

You've found my page, and I find that exciting.. Please connect with me! I'm graduating soon and 
I'm realigning my life goals with my new career choices insight of my goals. Let's be real, I'm 
from small town USA; I don't expect to become MJ overnight... Below I'll list my goals, and you'll
read them and tell me they're impossible. However, I will list them in hopes that you will agree with
my invested venture capitalisms .. "isms". 

💬 Production Builds uniquely avaliable: 
- "TradeAI": A knowledgable application that may assist with short-term, and long-term financial investments.
- My website: ejdev.com (Check it out, it's basically me. Let me know how to change it).

🤔 Unique Subdomains unavaliablely avaliable:
- Todos: The average todo app; but it allows for easy time management via sms, cmdl args, and app choices
- homeAI: TBA, TBD

Maybe this will excite you about my GitHub page. There's not much on the horizon, and until I succumb to boredom
I will probably maintain these respositories.
