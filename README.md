ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to prepare, design, and optimize Machine Learning Models.<br>
ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on understanding K-Mean Clusters, Sigularity Mappings, and Local Embeddings.<br>
ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on new and ongoing AI trends.<br>


âš¡ Fun fact: ... I have no Software experience, everything is off the rip this summer. We're leaning into it.

On a personal note; I will be providing a heroku [link](https://ej-portfolio-449d5d5f01b6.herokuapp.com/) shortly to angle traffic to a personal website.

I'll update it from time to time, and add more things to it as time goes on. I think a Time line would be cool.. but that's a me problem.<br>
