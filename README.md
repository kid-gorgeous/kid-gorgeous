### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**kid-gorgeous/kid-gorgeous** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ...
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ...
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on ...
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with ...
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about ...
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: ...
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: ...
- âš¡ Fun fact: ...
-->

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to prepare, design, and optimize Machine Learning Models.<br>
ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on new and ongoing AI trends.<br>
ðŸ¤” I'm still exploring and curious about cool applets, software, and computer architecture!<br>

You've found my page, and I find that exciting.. Please connect with me! I'm graduating soon and 
I'm realigning my life goals and career choices. But let's be real, I'm 
from small town USA; I don't expect to become MJ overnight... Below I'll list my goals, and you'll
read them and tell me they're impossible. However, I will list them in hopes that you will agree with
my erroneous adventurous ideas. 

ðŸ’¬ Production Builds uniquely avaliable somewhere out there: 
- "TradeAI": A knowledgable application that may assist with short-term, and long-term financial investments.
- My website: ejdev.com (Check it out, it's basically me. Let me know how to change it).

ðŸ¤” Unique ideas that are unavaliablely avaliable kindof hidden out there:
- TradeAI: somewhere easy to find
- homeAI: TBA, TBD
- "Project Whiteboard": School project that I'm building
- ... 

Maybe this will excite you about my GitHub page. There's a lot todo, and until I succumb to boredom
I will probably maintain these respositories.
