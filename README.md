## âœ¨ the kid gorgeous âœ¨
Hello, you've found my kindof private github. I try to provide small things weekly that help me and my workflows. I like to tinker around with ML enviornments and providing fast and simple cloud operations.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to implement, design, and deploy work AI models<br>
ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking for collaborattion, and new and state-of-the-art AI trends.<br>
ðŸ¤” I'm still exploring and curious about cool applets, software, and computer architecture!<br>

You've found my page, and I find that exciting, but please mind my privacy.. Please connect with me 
if you most certainly need to! But let's be real, I'm from small town USA; and you don't expect anything from me.
